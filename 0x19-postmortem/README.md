Programming can be very difficult, even for experts and people advanced in the field.
Thus, issues can arise in writing code and even deploying it to run for server functionality and other things.

The process of fixing those issues is called debugging, as those issues are caused by bugs or errors found in the code or source code written for that particular program.

However, it is important to document whatever issue or outage which occurs and this is called a Post-Mortem, detailing the issue faced, the root cause of the issue, when it happened and why, and also who noticed the issue and whether there was a system in place for early detection, as well as engineers who can fix the issue.

The postmortem exists to set a permanent record of an issue faced for the benefits of other employees, and the executives and management, in order to know how the issue happened and also how to avoid issues of that nature and any other issue in the nearest future.
